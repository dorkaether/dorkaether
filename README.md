# Finn Ellsworth: The Lost Soul, Revived

#### *"Hello, my name is Stevie - actually, I'm lying, it's really Kiwi"*

- Hello, if you're viewing this because somehow I gave you a link to access this -  you would probably know my ~~dead name~~ *legal* name
but, I might as well be blunt with it:

  My name is Finn Miles Pariño, legally known as Erin Casseapey Pariño, and my friends call me a variation of these names: Dorky, Dorks, Kieran and/or Kiwi.
  If it hasn't clued you in already (and I will be shocked if you haven't read my FB bio *at all*-), yes, I am trans masc non binary (He/They).

#### *"...a vile reminder that I would rather just forget (No matter where I go)"*

- I am a child of a doctor and a lawyer - both, in a way, renowned for their respective profession. Me? I don't know. I never thought of doing anything
  medical related and yet I took Pharmacy. I once thought of being a lawyer because of [*Ace Attorney*](https://www.ace-attorney.com/) - but that
  kinda didn't work. In other words, despite being a mixture of them, both my brain (and heart) lies elsewhere.
  
  I am the eldest of the three siblings - with the youngest being the one I cherish the most. People think, "Wow, they are the eldest - surely they're
  a great leader!", but I really have to disappoint you there bud - I'm no leader, but sure am a follower. 
  
  My hobbies - used to - include drawing and messing around with shell scripts (my old GitHub account will tell you about it) but after an event 
  that unravelled seven years of hell I just became numb at this point. But listen, I am trying. I am getting there.
  
  Nowadays I just spend the day away with playing two games consistently - [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/) and [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/).
  
  In the rare event that I play *other* than those two would probably be [V Rising](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/). I guess
  this kinda proves I still own a Windows laptop, eh?
  
#### *"Call me by name - this name I can't remember, I can't connect to"*
  
- As I stated above, I am trans masc non binary. I would probably talk a lot here but I will just keep it short: I am a person that is leaning towards
  masculine. So in other words, *please* no feminine pronouns. My legal name may suggest that (yes, that would make me afab - female at birth),
  but really I don't associate myself with it. At the very least refer to me as the singular pronoun They/Them if you're *really* confused.
    
#### *"Three, 365, not thinking 'bout ya - five, five to midnight, tick-tock, it's time"*
 
- If I can recall, albeit faintly, of what I learned since I started my programming journey back in 2011 it would be:
    
    - 2011: HTML (basics only) (2nd year high school)
    - 2012: Shell (Linux - self-learned)
    - 2015: C, C++ and Lua kinda? (Whatever the 3DS used at that time)
    - 2017: C++ (fully) and Python (Linux - 1st year BSIT)
    - late 2017: Coffeescript (MacOS - self-learned)
    - 2018: HTML (fully), CSS, Java and Javascript (MacOS - 2nd year BSIT)
    - 2019: Java (specifically Android) and Swift (MacOS/iOS) (MacOS - 3rd year BSIT)
    - late 2019 - half of 2022: break, although sometimes I went back to Linux to rehone(?) my skills? Also I managed to hack the Nintendo Switch and later
      the PS4 (fw 9.00) so I don't remember *exactly* what the programming language I've used on both

#### *"I don't want all of this to turn into what could've been - a chance at redemption"*

- Right now I went back to school after three years of no signs of life (not literally, although back then I kinda with it was like that-) and it's
  a new day. A chance at redemption.

  Thank you for reading. I hope the repositories I have up right now will help you along the way (as I learn, of course <3).
